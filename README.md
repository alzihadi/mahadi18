Iâ€™ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.

As a mobile app developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why Iâ€™m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
